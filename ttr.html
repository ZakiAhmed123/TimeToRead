  "Im in a clique but I want out Its not the same as when I was punched In the old days there was enough The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood I was in but I want out My mothers love is choking me Im sick of words that hang above my head What about the kid Its time the kid got free Be a part of the love club Everything will glow for you Youll get punched for the love club For the love club I joined the club and its all onThere are fights for being my best friend And the girls get their claws out Theres something about hanging out with the wicked kids Take the pill make it too ill The other day I forgot my old address Im sitting pretty on the throne Theres nothing more I want Except to be alone";
